# UNBEATABLE-Tic-Tac-Toe

The UNBEATABLE Tic Tac Toe Game was written in C++ and comiled with Gnu. The Minimax Algorithm is used to calcualte the best move. A great source for understanding the Minimax algorithm is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l-hh51ncgDI&t=249s, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fT3YWCKvuQE&t=522s, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trKjYdBASyQ&t=930s and https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-1-introduction/. 

I uploaded the .exe file, so if you want to play against the bot, just download this file and open it. This Tic Tac Toe **only works on a Windows**.
